### Brief Description of the Application

The application named ShortRec allows users to easily and conveniently record and play back short voice recordings stored in the cloud. In addition to playing the recordings, the user can rename them or assign an emoji representing the emotion associated with the recording.

### Technologies Used

The project was implemented using the Swift programming language and the Xcode 15.3 development environment, which provides a source code editor and the tools necessary for compiling and running the application itself. For debugging and testing, an emulated device iPhone 15 Pro (iOS 17.4) and a physical device iPhone 13 Pro Max (iOS 17.4.1) were used. Additionally, a set of backend services from Google Firebase was utilized to ensure user authentication, cloud database, and cloud data storage.
